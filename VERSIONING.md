# Ryze Version History and Architecture Guide

## Version 0.1 Summary

Completed on: April 8, 2025

### Implemented Features

1. **Project Structure**
   - MVVM architecture pattern
   - Directory layout: Models, Views, ViewModels, Services, Utils
   - SwiftUI for all UI components

2. **Data Models**
   - `Thought` model: id, question, createdAt, outcomes, expectedOutcome, deadline, actualOutcome, isResolved
   - `Outcome` model: id, type (enum: worst, worse, okay, good, better, best), description
   - OutcomeType enum: worst, worse, okay, good, better, best
   - JSON persistence layer (foundation for future CoreData implementation)

3. **Basic Navigation**
   - TabView with 4 main tabs: Dashboard, New Thought, History, Settings
   - New Thought implemented as a modal sheet triggered from the tab bar
   - Empty placeholder screens for each tab with basic UI structure

4. **Services**
   - DataStore: JSON-based persistence using Combine for reactive updates
   - NotificationManager: Structure for future local notifications

5. **Views**
   - Dashboard: Basic metrics display (pending complete implementation)
   - ThoughtList: List view with filtering and sorting
   - NewThought: Form for thought creation (UI only, needs complete implementation)
   - Settings: Basic settings page with privacy options

### Architecture Notes

1. **Dependency Injection**
   - ViewModels accept Services through constructors
   - Protocols used to define service interfaces (e.g., DataStoreProtocol)

2. **Reactive UI**
   - Combine publishers used to propagate data changes
   - ObservableObject pattern for ViewModels

3. **Future-Proofing**
   - Models use UUID for IDs to ensure uniqueness
   - Extensible model structures with helper methods
   - Notifications system prepared but not fully implemented

## For Version 0.2 Implementation

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Thought Creation Flow**
   - Add outcome input UI in NewThoughtView
   - Implement outcome selection mechanism
   - Connect the form to the persistence layer

2. **File Locations**
   - Main models: `/Ryze/Models/Thought.swift` and `/Ryze/Models/Outcome.swift`
   - ViewModel: `/Ryze/ViewModels/ThoughtViewModel.swift`
   - Main views:
     - TabView: `/Ryze/ContentView.swift`
     - New Thought form: `/Ryze/Views/Thoughts/NewThoughtView.swift`

3. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Do not reimplement what's already done in version 0.1
   - Focus on completing the NewThoughtView UI with outcome inputs
   - Enhance the form validation to require at least one outcome
   - Connect the created thought to the persistence layer
   - Test the complete thought creation flow

4. **Architecture Patterns to Follow**
   - Continue using MVVM with clear separation of concerns
   - Keep UI logic in views, business logic in view models
   - Use the established reactive patterns for data updates
   - Extend existing models rather than creating new ones
